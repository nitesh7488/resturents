css

This is the CSS file for the website. We have used CSS to style the HTML elements on the page.
We have used a combination of CSS properties like color, font-family, font-size, background-color, padding, margin, etc to make the page look visually appealing.
We have also used CSS media queries to ensure that the website is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.

Images

This folder contains all the images used in the project. We have used bg.jpg as the background image of the website. logo.png is the logo of the restaurant which we have used in the header section. menu1.jpg, menu2.jpg, and menu3.jpg are the images of the restaurant's menu items which we have used in the menu section.

To view the website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. We hope you enjoy our restaurant website!
